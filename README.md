Created by Tim Shaw for CS50

A simple web app with flask and django that simulates a game of wordle. 

This app also recommends words to guess using an algorithm written (mostly) by me. Give it a try!

Please note that this app is not intended for deployment. The word recommendation algorithm is server side and will most definitely break if multiple users attempt to use it.
